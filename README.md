# 📃 Safety Incident Reporter

## ℹ️ Overview

This is my take on an incident reporter, featuring a homepage, dashboard and contact page.

This project is also a part of my university work.

## ⬇️ Installation

The HTML section can be ran locally without any programs, just open the index.html.

The PHP section cannot be ran locally without a local server environment such as WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or XAMPP. See below for more information:

(WSL, incl. PHPMyAdmin, Apache2, MySQL etc..)
